  ## Classifications

  classification:
    description: >-
      a codified result from assessing evidence under a classification system
    slots:
      - classification system
      - classification outcome
      - has evidence

  clinical significance of variation classification:
    description: >-
      an assertion of clinical significance of a variation
    is_a: classification
    slots:
      - has variation profile

  ## There is a clinical actionability group SEPIO profile to check out
  ##  has similar relationships we may wish to reuse

  ## Consider SKOS for relationships (e.g. 'exact match')

  ## Evaluate SEPIO assertions

  therapeutic response from variation classification:
    description: >-
      an assertion of response to a therapy in presence of a variation
    is_a: clinical significance of variation classification
    slots:
      - has therapy profile
      - has disease context

  prognosis from variation classification:
    description: >-
      an assertion of prognosis in presence of a variation
    is_a: clinical significance of variation classification
    slots:
      - has disease context

  diagnosis from variation classification:
    description: >-
      an assertion of diagnosis in presence of a variation
    is_a: clinical significance of variation classification
    slots:
      - informs diagnosis

  ## Variation

  # Variation Profile

  variation profile:
    description: >-
      a set of variants and the relationships between them
    slots:
      - has variation descriptor or variation logical set
        # LB: alternative, consider variation logical set
      - label
      - description

  variation logical set:
    description: >-
      logical relationships between variation concepts
    slots:
      - has variation descriptors or variation logical sets
      - logical operator # AND, OR, NOT
      # need to define constraint for NOT

  variation descriptor:
    description: >-
      a value object descriptor for VRS Variation concepts
    is_a: vod:value object descriptor # guessing, still need to learn import syntax

  # slots:
  #   has variation descriptor or variation logical set:
  #     multivalued: true
  #     range: variation descriptor | variation logical set


  #### Example, variant 1 and variant 2 and variant 3
  # variation profile:
  #   variation logical set:
  #     has variation descriptor or variation logical set:
  #       [variation descriptor 1, variation descriptor 2, variation descriptor 3]
  #     logical operator: 'AND'
