# metakb

The intent of the project is to leverage the collective knowledge of the disparate existing resources of the VICC to improve the comprehensiveness of clinical interpretation of genomic variation. An ongoing goal will be to provide and improve upon standards and guidelines by which other groups with clinical interpretation data may make it accessible and visible to the public. We have released a preprint discussing our initial harmonization effort and observed disparities in the structure and content of variant interpretations.

## Getting Started

> These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

* python3

```
python3 --version
Python 3.7.1
```

### Installing

Install requirements

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install requirements-dev

```
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```


> TODO End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

### Unit tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

```
python3 -m pytest
```


### Break down into end to end tests

> TODO Explain what these tests test and why

```
TODO Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Code style is managed by [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) and checked prior to commit.

```
see .flake8
