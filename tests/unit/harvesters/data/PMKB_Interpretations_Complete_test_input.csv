NOTCH2,Marginal Zone B Cell Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma,Blood|Bone Marrow,NOTCH2 I2304fs|NOTCH2 exon(s) 34 frameshift,1,"NOTCH2 gain of function mutations have been reported in apprximately 25% of splenic marginal zone lymphomas and are thought to be rare in non-splenic marginal zone lymphomas.  These mutations are typically located near the C-terminal PEST domain and lead to protein truncation or, more rarely, are nonsynonymous substitution mutations affected the extracellular heterodimerization domain.  NOTCH2 mutations may be associated with a worse prognosis among cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma.  In addition, NOTCH2 PEST domain mutations have been reported in approximately 8% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas and in vitro systems have demonstrated these PEST domain mutant NOTCH2 receptors have increased activity compared to wild type NOTCH2.  In addion, copy number gain has been reported in a subset of DLBCL cases with NOTCH2 mutations. ","Lee SY, et al.

CXCR4,Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma,Blood|Bone Marrow,"",1,"CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor which has been shown to mutated in approximately 25-30% of patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia(WM). The mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations in the carboxy terminus of the protein.  Similar mutations are found in WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infection and Myelokathexis) syndrome, a rare, autsomal dominant genetic disorder. These mutations in the carboxy terminal tail  lead to impaired receptor desensitization and internalization, resulting in enhanced receptor activation and increased expression.  Almost all WM patients with mutation of CXCR4 also carry the MYD88 L265P mutation.  Mutations in CXCR4 appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in CD79A/CD79B.  Patients with CXCR4 mutations may be candidates for targeted therapy since CXCR4 antagonists have been used in patients with WHIM syndrome. The presence of CXCR4 mutations may affect response to Ibrutinib therapy according to some studies.","Hunter ZR, et al.

FGFR3,Adenocarcinoma|Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Papillary Carcinoma|Follicular Carcinoma,Lung|Breast|Colon|Pancreas|Thyroid|Liver,FGFR3 F384L,3,"FGFR3 is one of 4 high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors for the fibroblast growth factor family of ligands. On ligand stimulation, FGFR3 undergoes dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation, resulting in cell proliferation or differentiation, , through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospholipase Cg signal transduction pathways. Some FGFR3 mutations are believed to result in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. However, FGFR3 F384L mutation is not associated with activation of FGFR and, in NIH-3T3 cells, it was demonstrated to be devoid of any transforming activity.  In some cases, the possibility of FGFR3 variants being of germline origin, cannot be excluded. The FGFR3 F384L mutation has been reported as a benign/likely benign germline variant in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/134404/).

TP53,Adenocarcinoma,Colon|Rectum|Appendix,"",2,"Somatic mutations in TP53 are frequent in human cancer.  Germline TP53 mutations cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is associated with a range of early-onset cancers. The types and positions of TP53 mutations are diverse.  TP53 mutations may be potential prognostic and predictive markers in some tumor types, as well as targets for pharmacological intervention in some clinical settings. The IARC TP53 Database (http://www-p53.iarc.fr/) is a useful resource which catalogues TP53 mutations found in cancer.","Olivier et al.

EGFR,Adenocarcinoma,Lung,EGFR K757M,1,"Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in approximately 80% of the lung adenocarcinomas that respond to first and second generation EGFR inhibitors (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib). Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases. EGFR Exon 19 deletions, EGFR Exon 21 L858R and EGFR Exon 18 G719 mutations correlate strongly with sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors and the response rate to therapy with TKIs has been reported to be up to 80% in such cases. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M. EGFR K757M has been reported as a rare variant lung adenocarcinoma, but the significance remains to be elucidated.","Sequist LV, et al.
