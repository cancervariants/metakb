NOTCH2,Marginal Zone B Cell Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma,Blood|Bone Marrow,NOTCH2 I2304fs|NOTCH2 exon(s) 34 frameshift,1,"NOTCH2 gain of function mutations have been reported in apprximately 25% of splenic marginal zone lymphomas and are thought to be rare in non-splenic marginal zone lymphomas.  These mutations are typically located near the C-terminal PEST domain and lead to protein truncation or, more rarely, are nonsynonymous substitution mutations affected the extracellular heterodimerization domain.  NOTCH2 mutations may be associated with a worse prognosis among cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma.  In addition, NOTCH2 PEST domain mutations have been reported in approximately 8% of diffuse large B cell lymphomas and in vitro systems have demonstrated these PEST domain mutant NOTCH2 receptors have increased activity compared to wild type NOTCH2.  In addion, copy number gain has been reported in a subset of DLBCL cases with NOTCH2 mutations. ","Lee SY, et al.

FGFR3,Adenocarcinoma|Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Papillary Carcinoma|Follicular Carcinoma,Lung|Breast|Colon|Pancreas|Thyroid|Liver,FGFR3 F384L,3,"FGFR3 is one of 4 high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors for the fibroblast growth factor family of ligands. On ligand stimulation, FGFR3 undergoes dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation, resulting in cell proliferation or differentiation, , through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospholipase Cg signal transduction pathways. Some FGFR3 mutations are believed to result in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. However, FGFR3 F384L mutation is not associated with activation of FGFR and, in NIH-3T3 cells, it was demonstrated to be devoid of any transforming activity.  In some cases, the possibility of FGFR3 variants being of germline origin, cannot be excluded. The FGFR3 F384L mutation has been reported as a benign/likely benign germline variant in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/134404/).

However, FGFR3 F384L mutation is not associated with activation of FGFR and, in NIH-3T3 cells, it was demonstrated to be devoid of any transforming activity. FGFR3 is altered in 2.9% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
