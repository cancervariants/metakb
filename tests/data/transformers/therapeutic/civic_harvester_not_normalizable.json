Afatinib downregulates ErbB signalling by covalently binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER4, irreversibly inhibiting tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation. It also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Oral afatinib (Gilotrif\u2122) has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Afatinib has also been approved in Taiwan for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of afatinib (Giotrif\u00ae) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor na\u00efve. Afatinib is also under regulatory review in Canada, Japan and other Asian countries. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of afatinib, leading to this first approval in patients with metastatic NSCLC.",

            "description": "BRCA1 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase the risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.",

Investigators independently dual-rated study quality and applicability by using established criteria.Five referral models accurately estimated individual risk for BRCA mutations. Genetic counseling increased the accuracy of risk perception and decreases the intention for genetic testing among unlikely carriers and cancer-related worry, anxiety, and depression. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of intensive screening or risk-reducing medications in mutation carriers, although false-positive rates, unneeded imaging, and unneeded surgeries were higher with screening. Among high-risk women and mutation carriers, risk-reducing mastectomy decreased breast cancer by 85% to 100% and breast cancer mortality by 81% to 100% compared with women without surgery; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy decreased breast cancer incidence by 37% to 100%, ovarian cancer by 69% to 100%, and all-cause mortality by 55% to 100%.The analysis included only English-language articles;efficacy trials in mutation carriers were lacking.Studies of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer and mortality indicate potential benefits and harms that vary according to risk.",

In this landscape, the innovative treatment with PARP inhibitors (PARPis) demonstrated an outstanding activity in EOC, and is currently changing clinical practice in BRCA mutant patients.The study aimed to highlight the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical activity, indications and current strategies of development of Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, Talazoparib and Veliparib, the 5 most relevant PARPis.We performed a review on Pubmed using 'ovarian cancer' and the name of each PARPi (PARP inhibitor) discussed in the review as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords. The same search was performed on \"clinicaltrial.gov\" to identify ongoing clinical trials and on \"google. com/patents\" and \"uspto.gov\" for recent patents exploring PARPIs in ovarian cancer.Olaparib, Niraparib and Rucaparib are already approved for the treatment of recurrent EOC and their indications are partially overlapping. Talazoparib and Veliparib are promising PARPis, but currently under investigation in early phase trials. Several studies are evaluating PARPis in monotherapy or in associations, in a wide range of settings (i.e. first line, neoadjuvant, platinum-sensitive and resistant disease).PARPis are valuable options in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer with promising activity in different stages of this disease. Further studies are required to better define optimal clinical settings, predictors of response beyond BRCA mutations and strategies to overcome secondary resistance of PARPis therapy in EOC.",
