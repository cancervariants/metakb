Afatinib downregulates ErbB signalling by covalently binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER4, irreversibly inhibiting tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation. It also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Oral afatinib (Gilotrif\u2122) has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Afatinib has also been approved in Taiwan for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of afatinib (Giotrif\u00ae) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor na\u00efve. Afatinib is also under regulatory review in Canada, Japan and other Asian countries. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of afatinib, leading to this first approval in patients with metastatic NSCLC.",

However, whether this mutation is predictive of treatment benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is uncertain.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2014 that evaluated the effect of BRAF MT on the treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC.Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of overall survival (OS), whereas eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of progression-free survival (PFS). For RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours, the hazard ratio for OS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs was 0.97 (95% CI; 0.67-1.41), whereas the hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI; 0.70-0.95) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours. However, the test of interaction (P=0.43) was not statistically significant, highlighting that the observed differences in the effect of anti-EGFR mAbs on OS according to the BRAF mutation status may be due to chance alone. Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 0.86 (95% CI; 0.61-1.21) for RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours as compared with 0.62 (95% CI; 0.50-0.77) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours (test of interaction, P=0.07).This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is insufficient evidence to definitively state that RAS WT/BRAF MT individuals attain a different treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC compared with RAS WT/BRAF WT individuals. As such, there are insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR mAb therapy for patients with RAS WT/BRAF MT mCRC.",

Inhibition of BRAF alone has limited activity because of pathway reactivation through epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had had disease progression after one or two previous regimens. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators' choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) (control group). The primary end points were overall survival and objective response rate in the triplet-therapy group as compared with the control group. A secondary end point was overall survival in the doublet-therapy group as compared with the control group. We report here the results of a prespecified interim analysis.The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (P<0.001). The median overall survival in the doublet-therapy group was 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61% in the control group.A combination of encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and a higher response rate than standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation.

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

          "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell-surface receptor belonging to ErbB family of tyrosine kinase and it plays a vital role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. However; EGFR is aberrantly activated by various mechanisms like receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, ligand-independent activation and is associated with development of variety of tumors. Therefore, specific EGFR inhibition is one of the key targets for cancer therapy. Two major approaches have been developed and demonstrated benefits in clinical trials for targeting EGFR; monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR inhibitors like, cetuximab, panitumumab, etc. (mAbs) and gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, etc. (TKIs) are now commercially available for treatment of variety of cancers. Recently, many other agents like peptides, nanobodies, affibodies and antisense oligonucleotide have also shown better efficacy in targeting and inhibiting EGFR. Now a days, efforts are being focused to identify molecular markers that can predict patients more likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy; to find out combinatorial approaches with EGFR inhibitors and to bring new therapeutic agents with clinical efficacy. In this review we have outlined the role of EGFR in cancer, different types of EGFR inhibitors, preclinical and clinical status of EGFR inhibitors as well as summarized the recent efforts made in the field of molecular EGFR targeting.",

      "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

Patients suffering from PTC usually have a good outcome. However, a group of PTC patients still encounter high rates of recurrence and mortality. The BRAFV600E mutation is the most common genetic alteration identified in PTC, ranging from 29 to 83%, with the average rate about 40%. To date, a growing body of evidence has suggested that the BRAFV600E mutation plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of PTC, and it tends to be associated with special subtypes of PTC and predicts poor prognosis. Therefore, mutant BRAF has become an attractive cancer target for PTC. This article is focuses on reviewing the impact of the BRAFV600E mutation in the tumorigenesis of PTC, differences in the prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation in variants of PTC, and its detection methods. The novel advantages of the BRAFV600E mutation-targeted therapies in studies of PTC are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 200 BRAF mutant alleles have been identified in human tumours. Activating BRAF mutants cause feedback inhibition of GTP-bound RAS, are RAS-independent and signal either as active monomers (class 1) or constitutively active dimers (class 2). Here we characterize a third class of BRAF mutants-those that have impaired kinase activity or are kinase-dead. These mutants are sensitive to ERK-mediated feedback and their activation of signalling is RAS-dependent. The mutants bind more tightly than wild-type BRAF to RAS-GTP, and their binding to and activation of wild-type CRAF is enhanced, leading to increased ERK signalling. The model suggests that dysregulation of signalling by these mutants in tumours requires coexistent mechanisms for maintaining RAS activation despite ERK-dependent feedback. Consistent with this hypothesis, melanomas with these class 3 BRAF mutations also harbour RAS mutations or NF1 deletions. By contrast, in lung and colorectal cancers with class 3 BRAF mutants, RAS is typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. These tumours are sensitive to the inhibition of RAS activation by inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases. We have thus defined three distinct functional classes of BRAF mutants in human tumours. The mutants activate ERK signalling by different mechanisms that dictate their sensitivity to therapeutic inhibitors of the pathway.",
