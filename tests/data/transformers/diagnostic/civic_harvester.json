                "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are KIT expressing spindle cell, epithelioid and rarely pleomorphic mesenchymal tumors. The majority of GISTs show gain-of-function KIT mutations. However, GISTs without KIT mutations and GISTs with weak or lack of immunohistochemical KIT expression have also been reported. Recently, gain-of-function mutations in exon 18 (activation loop) and exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain) of the PDGFRA were identified in such tumors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PDGFRA mutation may define a specific clinicopathologic subgroup of GISTs. A total of 447 KIT exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutation-negative GISTs were studied. DNA samples were obtained from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Genomic sequences of PDGFRA exons 18 and 12 were evaluated for the mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PDGFRA exon 18 mutations were identified in 122 of 346 (35.3%) gastric GISTs and two of 75 (2.7%) intestinal GISTs. A great majority of these mutations represented simple T to A missense mutation at the codon 842 leading to substitution of the valine for aspartic acid (D842 V). However, in-frame deletions and deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 841-847 were found in approximately 23% of all exon 18 mutations. Mutations in PDGFRA exon 12 were found only in 10 of 170 (5.8%) gastric and one of 54 (1.9%) intestinal GISTs negative for KIT exon 11 and PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. There were seven substitutions of aspartic acid for valine at codon 561 (V561D) and four in-frame deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 566 and 571. The majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations had pure or predominant epithelioid morphology. Low mitotic activity, < or =5 mitoses/50HPF was detected in 81% of analyzed GISTs including larger, >5 cm tumors. Based on long-term follow-up (average 135 months), a majority (83.5%) of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations followed a benign course.",

KIT mutations in GIST are clustered in four exons. Most common are exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutations that include deletions, point mutations (affecting a few codons), and duplications (mostly in the 3' region). The latter mutations most often occur in gastric GISTs. Among gastric GISTs, tumors with deletions are more aggressive than those with point mutations; this does not seem to hold true in small intestinal GISTs. Exon 9 mutations (5-10%) usually are 2-codon 502-503 duplications, and these occur predominantly in intestinal versus gastric GISTs. Lesser imatinib sensitivity of these tumors has been noted. Kinase domain mutations are very rare; GISTs with such mutations are variably sensitive to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations usually occur in gastric GISTs, especially in the epithelioid variants; their overall frequency is approximately 30% to 40% of KIT mutation negative GISTs. Most common is exon 18 mutation leading Asp842Val at the protein level. This mutation causes imatinib resistance. Exon 12 and 14 mutations are rare. Most mutations are somatic (in tumor tissue only), but patients with familial GIST syndrome have consitutitonal KIT/PDGFRA mutations; >10 families have been reported worldwide with mutations generally similar to those in sporadic GISTs. GISTs in neurofibromatosis 1 patients, children, and Carney triad seem to lack GIST-specific KIT and PDGFRA mutations and may have a different disease mechanism. Secondary mutations usually occur in KIT kinase domains in patients after imatinib treatment resulting in resistance to this drug. Mutation genotyping is a tool in GIST diagnosis and in assessment of sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.",

Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists.

The majority of thyroid carcinomas are differentiated entities (papillary and folliculary carcinomas) and are characterized by good prognosis and good response to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Nevertheless, about 10% of differentiated carcinomas recur and become resistant to all therapies. Anaplastic and medullary cancers are rare subtypes of thyroid cancer not suitable for radioiodine therapy. A small percentage of differentiated and all the anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas often recur after primary treatments and are no longer suitable for other therapies. In the last years, several advances have been made in the field of molecular biology and tumorigenesis mechanisms of thyroid carcinomas. Starting from these issues, the targeted therapy may be employed as a new option. The MAP-Kinase pathway has been found often dysregulated in thyroid carcinomas and several upstream signals have been recognized as responsible for this feature. RET/PTC mutations are often discovered both in papillary and in medullary carcinomas, while B-RAF mutation is typical of papillary and anaplastic histologies. Also mTOR disruptions and VEGFR pathway disruption are common features in all advanced thyroid cancers. Some angiogenesis inhibitors and a number of RET/PTC pathway blocking agents are yet present in the clinical armamentarium. Vandetanib, cabozatinib and sorafenib have reached clinical use. A number of other biological compounds have been tested in phase II and III trials. Understanding the biology of thyroid cancers may help us to design a well shaped targeted therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) are commonly and successfully treated with total thyroidectomy plus/minus radioiodine therapy (RAI). Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is only treated with surgery but only intrathyroidal tumors are cured. The worst prognosis is for anaplastic (ATC) and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC). Whenever a local or metastatic advanced disease is present, other treatments are required, varying from local to systemic therapies. In the last decade, the efficacy of the targeted therapies and, in particular, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been demonstrated. They can prolong the disease progression-free survival and represent the most important therapeutic option for the treatment of advanced and progressive thyroid cancer. Currently, lenvatinib and sorafenib are the approved drugs for the treatment of RAI-refractory DTC and PDTC while advanced MTC can be treated with either cabozantinib or vandetanib. Dabrafenib plus trametinib is the only approved treatment by FDA for BRAFV600E mutated ATC. A new generation of TKIs, specifically for single altered oncogenes, is under evaluation in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current and future treatments of thyroid cancer with regards to the advanced and progressive cases that require systemic therapies that are becoming more and more targeted on the molecular identity of the tumor.",

Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).",
