        "abstract": "Afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases, is under development with Boehringer Ingelheim for the once-daily, oral treatment of cancer. Afatinib downregulates ErbB signalling by covalently binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER4, irreversibly inhibiting tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation. It also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Oral afatinib (Gilotrif\u2122) has been approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have tumours with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test. Afatinib has also been approved in Taiwan for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of afatinib (Giotrif\u00ae) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations who are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor na\u00efve. Afatinib is also under regulatory review in Canada, Japan and other Asian countries. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of afatinib, leading to this first approval in patients with metastatic NSCLC.",

      "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

          "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell-surface receptor belonging to ErbB family of tyrosine kinase and it plays a vital role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. However; EGFR is aberrantly activated by various mechanisms like receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, ligand-independent activation and is associated with development of variety of tumors. Therefore, specific EGFR inhibition is one of the key targets for cancer therapy. Two major approaches have been developed and demonstrated benefits in clinical trials for targeting EGFR; monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR inhibitors like, cetuximab, panitumumab, etc. (mAbs) and gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, etc. (TKIs) are now commercially available for treatment of variety of cancers. Recently, many other agents like peptides, nanobodies, affibodies and antisense oligonucleotide have also shown better efficacy in targeting and inhibiting EGFR. Now a days, efforts are being focused to identify molecular markers that can predict patients more likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy; to find out combinatorial approaches with EGFR inhibitors and to bring new therapeutic agents with clinical efficacy. In this review we have outlined the role of EGFR in cancer, different types of EGFR inhibitors, preclinical and clinical status of EGFR inhibitors as well as summarized the recent efforts made in the field of molecular EGFR targeting.",

EGFR activation results in a series of downstream signaling events that mediate cancer cell growth, proliferation, motility, adhesion, invasion, apoptosis inhibition and metastasis as well as resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, EGFR inhibitors seem to be an effective therapy for some patients with previously treated NSCLC. A thorough investigation of EGFR, its major signaling pathways, its identification and biology in NSCLC and the responsiveness to gefitinib, erlotinib and cetuximab in connection to EGFR mutations as well as the possible mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the scope of this review.",
