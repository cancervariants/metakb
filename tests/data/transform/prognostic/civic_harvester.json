To evaluate their prognostic significance, 67 adult patients with CBFL were analyzed to ascertain the c-KIT mutation status. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), the presence of c-KIT TKD mutation at codon 816 (TKD(816)) was associated with a high white blood cell count at diagnosis (median, 29.60 x 10(9)/L) and a higher incidence (33%) of extramedullary leukemia (EML) during the course of the disease. Data also showed that the TKD(816) mutated patients (n = 12) had a significantly higher incidence of relapse and a lower overall survival (OS) at 24 months, compared with the 17 c-KIT unmutated (c-KIT(-)) patients (90% vs 35.3%, P = .002; 25% vs 76.5%, P = .006, respectively). No difference in relapse incidence (P = .126) and OS (P = .474) was observed between the c-KIT mutated other than TKD(816) (n = 7) and the c-KIT(-) patients. These findings indicate that c-KIT TKD(816) mutation has a negative impact on the outcome of AML with t(8;21).",

In this large-scale, hospital-based, case-control study of 1817 PCa cases and 2026 cancer-free controls, we aimed to clarify the association between these two MTHFR variants and PCa risk in Shanghai and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that both the heterozygous CT (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.92) and the homozygous TT genotypes (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) of c.677C>T were associated with a significantly decreased risk of PCa compared with homozygous wild-type CC genotype, respectively, using multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, we confirmed that MTHFR c.677T allele was related to an increased serum homocysteine level in the Han Chinese population in Shanghai. In the cultured PCa cell lines, we observed that MTHFR c.677T could elevate the cellular homocysteine level and cause DNA damage, thus increasing cell apoptosis and finally inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, MTHFR c.677T was a protective factor of PCa risk in ethnic Han Chinese males by inducing DNA damage and cell apoptosis.",

Detailed structural and functional studies of RTKs, including the stem cell factor receptor c-KIT, revealed the complexity of these receptor systems and contributed to development of targeted clinical approaches with relevance in both prognosis and therapy. C-KIT signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical strategies to identify novel target-based approaches for cancer treatment. Evidence that c-KIT signaling promotes cell proliferation and survival, along with the frequency in which this pathway is aberrantly activated in cancer, support the current efforts to identify approaches for its efficient inhibition. C-KIT mutations are associatied with several human malignancies, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, mast cell leukemia, and melanoma. Novel therapies are developed that target some of the identified genetic defects. It is therefore anticipated that newly-identified genetic markers will acquire a predictive value, that is, the ability to predict differential efficacy of a therapy. This review describes the evolving understanding of c-KIT/SCF axis and their downstream signaling in cancer, and the strategies for c-KIT-directed targeted cancer therapy.",

                    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms with the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy.One-hundred and sixteen patients with gastric cancer were treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The TS (a 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism in the TS enhancer region (TSER) and a 6 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region) and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were determined in blood samples from those patients using PCR and PCR-LDR (ligation detection reaction) method, respectively.The overall survival (OS) in patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype was significantly shorter than those in patients with the del6/del6 (P = 0.017) and ins6/del6 (P = 0.022) genotype. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS in patients with the MTHFR C/C genotype were significantly worse than those in patients with the T/T or C/T genotype (P = 0.043 and 0.040, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis also showed that patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype have worse OS than patients with the T/T or C/T genotype (HR = 2.437, P = 0.041), and the MTHFR C/C genotype was associated with shorter RFS (HR = 1.723, P = 0.031) and OS (HR = 1.681, P = 0.056). No significant association was found between the TSER polymorphism and the clinical outcomes (P > 0.05).The polymorphisms of TS 3'-UTR ins6/del6 and MTHFR C677T appear to be potential prognostic factors in gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which may allow identification of gastric cancer patients who will benefit from 5-FU chemotherapy.",

In this large-scale, hospital-based, case-control study of 1817 PCa cases and 2026 cancer-free controls, we aimed to clarify the association between these two MTHFR variants and PCa risk in Shanghai and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that both the heterozygous CT (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.92) and the homozygous TT genotypes (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) of c.677C>T were associated with a significantly decreased risk of PCa compared with homozygous wild-type CC genotype, respectively, using multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, we confirmed that MTHFR c.677T allele was related to an increased serum homocysteine level in the Han Chinese population in Shanghai. In the cultured PCa cell lines, we observed that MTHFR c.677T could elevate the cellular homocysteine level and cause DNA damage, thus increasing cell apoptosis and finally inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, MTHFR c.677T was a protective factor of PCa risk in ethnic Han Chinese males by inducing DNA damage and cell apoptosis.",
