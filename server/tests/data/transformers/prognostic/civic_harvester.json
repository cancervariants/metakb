To evaluate their prognostic significance, 67 adult patients with CBFL were analyzed to ascertain the c-KIT mutation status. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), the presence of c-KIT TKD mutation at codon 816 (TKD(816)) was associated with a high white blood cell count at diagnosis (median, 29.60 x 10(9)/L) and a higher incidence (33%) of extramedullary leukemia (EML) during the course of the disease. Data also showed that the TKD(816) mutated patients (n = 12) had a significantly higher incidence of relapse and a lower overall survival (OS) at 24 months, compared with the 17 c-KIT unmutated (c-KIT(-)) patients (90% vs 35.3%, P = .002; 25% vs 76.5%, P = .006, respectively). No difference in relapse incidence (P = .126) and OS (P = .474) was observed between the c-KIT mutated other than TKD(816) (n = 7) and the c-KIT(-) patients. These findings indicate that c-KIT TKD(816) mutation has a negative impact on the outcome of AML with t(8;21).",

Detailed structural and functional studies of RTKs, including the stem cell factor receptor c-KIT, revealed the complexity of these receptor systems and contributed to development of targeted clinical approaches with relevance in both prognosis and therapy. C-KIT signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical strategies to identify novel target-based approaches for cancer treatment. Evidence that c-KIT signaling promotes cell proliferation and survival, along with the frequency in which this pathway is aberrantly activated in cancer, support the current efforts to identify approaches for its efficient inhibition. C-KIT mutations are associatied with several human malignancies, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, mast cell leukemia, and melanoma. Novel therapies are developed that target some of the identified genetic defects. It is therefore anticipated that newly-identified genetic markers will acquire a predictive value, that is, the ability to predict differential efficacy of a therapy. This review describes the evolving understanding of c-KIT/SCF axis and their downstream signaling in cancer, and the strategies for c-KIT-directed targeted cancer therapy.",
