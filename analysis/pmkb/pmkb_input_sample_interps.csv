SMAD4,"Astrocytoma, NOS|Astrocytoma, Anaplastic|Glioblastoma",Brain,SMAD4 I525V,3,https://pmkb.org/therapies/2146,SMAD4 is tumor suppressor gene and it encodes an intracellular mediator in the transforming growth factor b (TGF b) signal transduction pathway. Somatic mutations in SMAD4 are exceedingly rare in glial neoplasms. SMAD4 I525V has been reported as a likely benign germline variant in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/41788/). These results should be interpreted in the clinical context.,"Ceccarelli M, et al. Molecular Profiling Reveals Biologically Discrete Subsets and Pathways of Progression in Diffuse Glioma.

CDKN2A,Adenocarcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Colon|Rectum,"",2,https://pmkb.org/therapies/242,"CDKN2A gene functions as an important tumour suppressor in various human malignancies including colorectal cancer, and its activation prevents carcinogenesis via induction of cell growth arrest and senescence.  Majority of the CDKN2A mutations span exon 2 and result in loss or decreased binding to CDK4/6 leading to uncontrolled cell growth through inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways. Somatic mutations of CDKN2A are present in various tumor types but have not been well characterized in colorectal cancer. However, epigenetic silencing of CDKN2A by hypermethylation has been reported be a possible predictive factor of poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.","Rayess H, et al.
