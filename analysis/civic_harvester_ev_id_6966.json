The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was deemed safe and tolerable. Confirmed objective responses were seen in 15% of vemurafenib progressed patients and median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2\u00b76\u20133\u00b74). Confirmed objective responses were seen in 87% of patients who had never received BRAF inhibitor, including 10% with complete response. Median progression-free survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 10\u00b71\u201317\u00b75). The majority of patients had BRAF V600E mutation. Post-hoc sequencing of 94 tumor samples indicated seven tumors with a mutation other than BRAF V600E.",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after the treatment of subjects with solid tumors. This is a two-part study. Part 1 will identify the recommended Part 2 dose using a dose-escalation procedure. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum tolerated dose is established, or the toxicokinetic safety limit is reached. The recommended Part 2 dose will be expanded to up to 12 patients. Part 2 will explore further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2118436 in subjects with BRAF mutation-positive tumors. In addition, the effect of GSK2118436 on midazolam will be assessed in a subset of patients in Part 2. Biologically active doses will be identified by measurement of pharmacodynamic markers in tumor tissue and blood across a range of doses and these doses may be explored in Part 2.",

Only 12% of patients showed  partial response or better, with one complete response lasting 36 months and ongoing after data cutoff. 56% of patients achieved stable disease. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, longer than the median PFS (2.5 months) reported for metastatic CRC treated with standard chemotherapy.

One response was observed; however, approximately half the patients had tumor regression that did not meet the standard criteria for a partial response. Median progression-free survival and overall survival for patients receiving combination therapy were 3.7 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 5.1) and 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached), respectively. Patients were heavily pretreated, with a median of two lines of previous therapy (range, one to six).",

The patients were randomized into groups with irinotecan and cetuximab with vemurafenib (VIC group) or without (IC group). The VIC group showed an improvement of progression of free survival (HR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.66, p < 0.001) with a median value of 4.4 months compared to 2.0 months for the IC group. In addition, for the VIC group, there was a 16% drug response rate while the IC group had a 4% drug response rate (p-value = 0.08). Some grade 3/4 adverse events were higher in the experimental arm, and skin toxicity and fatigue showed no increase.",

                            "description": "This is a 2-part, study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral dabrafenib in children and adolescent subjects with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive solid tumors. Part 1 (dose escalation study) will identify the recommended Part 2 (tumor-specific expansion study) dose and regimen using a dose-escalation procedure. Approximately 6 to 18 subjects will participate in Part 1 and will receive a starting dose of 3 mg/kg and dose will deescalate or escalate between 1.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) and 6 mg/kg. Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at one dose level dependent upon the number of subjects at the current dose level, the number of subjects who have experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but with data pending at the current dose level. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, or until the dose in which the median pharmacokinetic parameters consistent with exposure in adults are achieved. Cohorts may be added in order to evaluate additional dose levels. Part 2 consists of four disease-specific cohorts of subjects with tumors known to have BRAF V600 activation (pediatric low-grade gliomas, pediatric high-grade gliomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis [LCH], and other tumors such as melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC]). Each cohort will enroll at least 10 subjects with a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose disease assessment. In both the parts of the study, on Day 1, a single first dose will be administered, and repeat dosing will begin on Day 2. PK sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 for subjects >=25 kg in weight. For subjects <25 kg and >=10 kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 15. For subjects <10kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study. Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression or until no clinical benefit or development of an unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent or begin a new therapy. At the end of treatment, a final study visit will occur.",
