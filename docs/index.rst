The VICC Meta-Knowledgebase
===========================

.. image:: /images/mkb-overview.png

The Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (`VICC`_) meta-knowledgebase is a harmonized
collection of clinical variant interpretations and related variant information informing of
the clinical significance of variants observed in human cancers.

The meta-knowledgebase was created to evaluate the disparities in variant interpretation
content and structure across established resources of clinical interpretation knowledge.
The result of this work is described in full detail in our 2020 *Nature Genetics* `publication`_.

This site is reference documentation for using the associated `web interface`_ for searching
the meta-knowledgebase.
