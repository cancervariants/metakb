The VICC Meta-Knowledgebase (MetaKB) is a search interface for cancer variant interpretations assembled by aggregating and harmonizing across multiple cancer variant interpretation knowledgebases. The MetaKB was created to evaluate the disparities in variant interpretation content and structure across established resources of clinical interpretation knowledge. By normalizing relevant biomedical components to consistent identifiers and transforming claims into data structures established by the `GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Work Stream <https://www.ga4gh.org/work_stream/genomic-knowledge-standards/>`_, the MetaKB supports combination and comparison of genomic medical evidence for research and clinical applications.

MetaKB v2 is in `active <https://www.github.com/cancervariants/metakb/issues>`_ :doc:`development <changelog>`. A prior version of this project is described in detail in our 2020 `Nature Genetics publication <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0603-8>`_. `Documentation <https://docs.cancervariants.org/en/stable/>`_ and a `web interface <https://search.cancervariants.org/#*>`_ are available for this prior version of the MetaKB.

This documentation is also a work in progress, and may contain incomplete sections.
