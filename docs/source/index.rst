The Meta-Knowledgebase leverages the collective knowledge of the disparate existing resources of the cancer genomics community to improve the comprehensiveness of clinical interpretation of genomic variation. It utilizes biomedical concept normalization routines to transform ingested interpretation data into a standardized knowledge model that links evidence items according to

An ongoing goal will be to provide and improve upon standards and guidelines by which other groups with clinical interpretation data may make it accessible and visible to the public. We have released a preprint discussing our initial harmonization effort and observed disparities in the structure and content of variant interpretations.
