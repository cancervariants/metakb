## 🧹 Formatting & Linting

MetaKB uses automated tooling to maintain consistent code quality across the project.

### Frontend (`client/`)

- Uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for TypeScript/React.
- Available scripts:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter client lint         # Lint the project
  pnpm --filter client format       # Check formatting
  pnpm --filter client format:fix   # Auto-fix formatting issues
  ```

### Backend (`server/`)

- Uses **Ruff** for linting and formatting Python code.
- To manually check or fix:

  ```bash
  ruff check server
  ruff format server
  ```

### Git Hooks (pre-commit)

- We use **Husky** and **lint-staged** to automatically lint and format staged files on commit
- Hooks run automatically after `pnpm install` via a `prepare` script
- To manually test:

  ```bash
  pnpm lint-staged
  ```

Thanks! ❤️
